Made with ❤️ by [unmock](https://www.unmock.io/).

### Description

Are you a developer using third-party APIs? Easily create formal OpenAPI specification from written API documentation directly in-browser to:

- write better tests
- automatically generate client code
- migrate legacy documentation to documentation autogenerated from OpenAPI specification

### Features

- Smartly parse OpenAPI specification from written documentation
- Use Swagger editor directly in-browser to fill in the blanks

Note that the smart parser is in early-stage development. We welcome contributions and feature requests at https://github.com/unmock/unmock-webextension/issues.

### Get started

- Install extension
- Open a page containing written API documentation, for example, https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/v2.html
- Extension icon should light up with a badge. Open Swagger editor from the pop-up window to autogenerate specification template.
- Fill in the missing parts
- Export the finished specification
